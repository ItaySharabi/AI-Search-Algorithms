# Informed Search algorithms

## A* - The Cream of the Crop
A* (A Star) is a very special algorithm.
It is an "informed algorithm", which evaluates nodes at the time of search,
with a special estimation method which is being applied specifically to `State`s and not `Node`s - `Herusitic Evaluation`.

A* is special because it relies only on a given heuristic evaluation (See `Manhattan Distance`) function,
`h(x) : V --> [0, N]`, which if accurate enough - produces amazing path-finding solutions!

If visualizing A* - then you can see how it avoids going in wrong directions, and you can see it 
bursting towards the target!
